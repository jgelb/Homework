Review of Code from:

https://github.com/NicholasLYang/APCSProject

The board class builds a 15 by 15 board, and makes each space a tile.

A method assign letter puts a letter on a specified tile.

The GUI class simply sets up the graphic elements of the board, including color, size, and shape.

In the Letterval class, there seems to be a function that adds letters to the board?

The player class includes variables for score, and player name.  
There is also a method that places a letter on the board.

The Tiles class contains more variables that determine if a piece has been placed, what letter is on the tile, and how many points the tile is worth.
