Our program can add words in all directions.  It can get words from either an array, or a text file.  After running, it generates 2 files, one of which contains the puzzle.  The other one contains the locations of the words (solution).

Files:

Wordsearch.java - Source code for the Wordsearch class. It generates and processes the source code

Exec.java - AKA Driver.java. Runs a basic wordsearch creation, which creates 2 files: WORDSEARCH.key and WORDSEARCH.puzzle

WORDSEARCH.key - Answer key to the generated puzzle

WORDSEARCH.puzzle - The generated puzzle

StressTest.java - Variation of Exec.java to take arguments and test runtimes. Includes test results

wordlist.in - Wordlist file to test the getWordsFromFile function in Wordsearch.java
